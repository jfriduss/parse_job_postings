Note how, in the first html file, the first sentence is black, indicating the model predicted it does not contain any tokens to label. But it contains the general area of focus of the company, 'AI robotics', so by criterion 3 of the annotation guidelines, it does contain tokens to be annotated by the token classification model. Therefore, in the list above after \"Please open the file 'predictions_on_sentences.html' and then input a list with the indices of the sentences that were labelled incorrectly.\", it's index is in that list. The second list contains the analagous information about the predictions from the token classification model: [0,7,0] indicats that the 7th word in the 0th sentence in html document, should be labelled with a 'B' for 'beginning', instead of an 'O' for other.\n",

Recall was chosen above other metrics, because, in this case, it is most important: false negatives are more detrimental to the projects goals compared to false positives, because they information that a prospective applicant would benefit from knowing about the position, that the applicant does not recieve. In contrast, false positive represent unnecissary information, which might be tedious to have, but does not detract from gauging whether the applicant is qualified for the position or not. Additionally, both metrics were calculated without accounting for if the model swapped the beginning label, 'B' and the inside label, 'I'--they only distinguish whether a 'B' or 'I' was mistaken for an 'O', or vis versa. This choice was made, because words labelled 'B' and 'I' are both extracted from the posting, whereas words labelled 'O' are not, and so what is most important is not confusing 'B/I' with 'O', or vis versa."
